> A high level overview of Faux's architecture.

Faux is composed of the following components:

- An `api` which a game is built upon.
- An `editor` which allows editing certain aspect of a game.
- A `runtime` which runs a game for a specific platform.
- An `asset-processor` which converts a game's assets to a format `editor`
  and `runtime` understands.
